# karma-remap-istanbul

This fork uses a pre-release of `remap-istanbul` that fixes [an issue where the folder structure is not shown in the generated html coverage report](https://github.com/SitePen/remap-istanbul/issues/50).

Currently used by the what-drops-now-frontend, will be obsolete as soon as the original `karma-remap-istanbul` fork uses version 0.6.5 of `remap-istanbul` as depenency.
